# In Python programming, flow control is the order in which statements or blocks of code are executed at runtime based on a condition.

# Control Flow Statements

# Conditional statements
# Iterative statements
# Transfer statements


#
# Conditional statements
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false. You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition. Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.
#
#
# There are three types of conditional statements.
#
# if statement
# if-else
# if-elif-else
# nested if-else


# If statement in Python
# In control statements, The if statement is the simplest form. It takes a condition and evaluates to either True or False.
#
# If the condition is True, then the True block of code will be executed,
# and if the condition is False, then the block of code is skipped, and The controller moves to the next line
#
# Syntax of the if statement
#
# if condition:
#      statement 1
#      statement 2
#      statement n

a = False

if a:
    print('When I am True , will excuted')

print('I am New line')
