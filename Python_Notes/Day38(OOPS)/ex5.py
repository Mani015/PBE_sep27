# def: The keyword is used to define function.
# __init__() Method: It is a reserved method. This method gets called as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
# self: The first argument self refers to the current object. It binds the instance to the __init__() method.
# Itâ€™s usually named self to follow the naming convention.



# If we create three objects,
# the constructor is called three times and initialize each object.
