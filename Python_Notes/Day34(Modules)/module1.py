# In Python, modules refer to the Python file, which contains
# Python code like Python statements, classes, functions, variables, etc.
#  A file with Python code is defined with extension.py

# In Python, large code is divided into small modules.
# The benefit of modules is, it provides a way to share reusable functions.
#
#
# Types of modules
# In Python, there are two types of modules.
#
# Built-in Modules
# User-defined Modules
# Built-in modules
# Built-in modules come with default Python installation.
# One of Pythonâ€™s most significant advantages is its rich library support
# that contains lots of built-in modules. Hence, it provides a lot of reusable code.
#
# Some commonly used Python built-in modules are datetime, os, math, sys, random, etc.
#
# User-defined modules
# The modules which the user defines or create are called a user-defined module.
# We can create our own module, which contains classes, functions, variables, etc., as per our requirements.
