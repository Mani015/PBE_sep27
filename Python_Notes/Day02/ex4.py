# To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

print(type(n1))
# <class 'int'>
print(type(120))
# <class 'int'>


# Float

n2 = 10.20
print(n2)
# 10.20
print(type(n2))
# <class 'float'>


# Complex
# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
# syn : real + Imaginary

c1 = 10 + 2j
print(c1)
# (10+2j)
print(type(c1))
# <class 'complex'>
